# Spanish Immigration Project
## Statistics module final project on Spanish immigration

This was my project for the Statistics module of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. I decided to explore Spanish immigration and find factors that might explain this phenomena.
It's obviously a very complex topic, but I'm pleased with the end result, and most of all, it was a great opportunity to practice what I've learned so far.

The databases used are included in the repository so it's ready to execute!
